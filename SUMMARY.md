## What You Need to Do

### Step 1: Update Google Cloud Console OAuth Scopes

Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com) > APIs & Services > OAuth consent screen:

1. Click "EDIT APP"
2. Go to "Scopes"
3. Click "ADD OR REMOVE SCOPES"
4. Add these scopes (if not already present):
   - `openid` (Open ID Connect)
   - `profile` (See your profile information)
   - `email` (See your email address)
5. Make sure you already have:
   - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.readonly`
6. Click "UPDATE" > "SAVE AND CONTINUE"

### Step 2: Restart Development Server

**CRITICAL**: You must restart your dev server after any environment changes:

```bash
# In your terminal, stop the server (Ctrl+C)
npm run dev
```

### Step 3: Clear Browser Cache

Open your browser in **incognito/private mode** or clear cache before testing.

### Step 4: Test Login

1. Go to `http://localhost:3000`
2. Enter your OpenAI API key (if prompted)
3. Click "Sign in with Google"
4. You should see the Google OAuth consent screen
5. Grant permissions and log in

## Troubleshooting

### Still getting errors?

1. **Verify Client ID**: Check `.env.local` has your Client ID
2. **Authorized Origins**: Make sure `http://localhost:3000` is in Google Cloud Console
3. **Test User**: If in testing mode, add your email as a test user
4. **Console Logs**: Check browser console (F12) for any errors

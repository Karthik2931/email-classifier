# How to Find the OAuth Consent Screen

## You're Still on the Wrong Page!

You're currently on **"OAuth Overview"** which shows metrics. This is NOT where you add scopes.

## Correct Steps:

### Step 1: Use the Search Bar (Top Center)

1. In the search bar, you currently have just "o" typed
2. **Click in the search bar** (on the "o")
3. **Delete the "o"** 
4. **Type the FULL phrase**: `OAuth consent screen`
5. **Press Enter** or click the first search result

### Step 2: Alternative Method via Menu

If search doesn't work, use the hamburger menu:

1. Click the **hamburger menu icon** (☰) in the top-left corner
2. Scroll down and find **"APIs & Services"**
3. Click on **"APIs & Services"**
4. In the submenu that appears, look for **"OAuth consent screen"**
5. Click on it

### Step 3: Once You're On OAuth Consent Screen

You should see:
- Page title: "OAuth consent screen"
- A button that says **"EDIT APP"** or "CONFIGURE CONSENT SCREEN"
- Sections like: App information, Scopes, Test users, Summary

If this is your first time:
1. Click **"CONFIGURE CONSENT SCREEN"** (or "CREATE" button)
2. Select **"External"** for User Type
3. Click **"CREATE"**
4. Fill in App information
5. Click **"SAVE AND CONTINUE"** until you reach **"Scopes"**
6. Click **"ADD OR REMOVE SCOPES"**
7. Add your scopes
8. Continue through the remaining steps

## Visual Guide to What You're Looking For:

**Current Page (WRONG):**
```
Google Auth Platform / Overview
├── Traffic (empty)
├── Errors (empty)  
└── Users (empty)
```

**Correct Page (RIGHT):**
```
OAuth consent screen
├── EDIT APP button
├── App information
├── Scopes
├── Test users  
└── Summary
```

## Pro Tip:

The **"OAuth consent screen"** page will have these options:
- User Type: External
- App name, support email, etc.
- **SCOPES** section where you can "ADD OR REMOVE SCOPES"
- Test users section

You should see "Scopes" or "Data access" as one of the sections!

## Still Can't Find It?

Try these exact search terms in the search bar (one at a time):
1. `consent screen`
2. `oauth consent`  
3. `scopes`

One of these should work!

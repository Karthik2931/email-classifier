## What You Need to Do NOW

### CRITICAL: Add Your Email as Test User

Your Google OAuth app is in "Testing" mode, which means only approved test users can access it. You need to add your email.

**Steps (takes 2 minutes):**

1. **Open:** https://console.cloud.google.com/
2. **Search:** "OAuth consent screen" (in the top search bar)
3. **Click:** "OAuth consent screen" from results
4. **Click:** "EDIT APP" or "CONFIGURE CONSENT SCREEN" button
5. **Scroll down** to "Test users" section
6. **Click:** "ADD USERS" or "+ ADD USERS"
7. **Type your email:** `nadellakarthikkumar@gmail.com`
8. **Click:** "ADD" or "SAVE"
9. **Click:** "SAVE AND CONTINUE" or "BACK TO DASHBOARD"

### Restart Your Dev Server

After adding your email, you MUST restart the dev server:

```bash
# In your terminal running npm run dev:
# 1. Press Ctrl+C to stop
# 2. Run: npm run dev
# 3. Refresh your browser
```

### Try Again

1. Refresh your browser at `http://localhost:3000`
2. Click "Sign in with Google"
3. You should now be able to login! ✅

## Why This Error Occurred

The error "Access blocked: Web application has not completed the Google verification process" (403: access_denied) happens because:

1. Your Google OAuth app is in **"Testing"** mode (normal for development)
2. Only users added to the "Test users" list can access the app
3. Your email (`nadellakarthikkumar@gmail.com`) was not on that list

## Alternative: Publish Your App (Optional)

If you want to allow any user to access your app:
1. Go to OAuth consent screen
2. Click "PUBLISH APP" under Publishing status
3. Click "CONFIRM"

**Note:** This may require Google review if requesting sensitive scopes.

## Files Changed

1. `app/components/LoginForm.tsx` - Improved error handling
2. `.env.local` - Created with your Client ID
3. New documentation files created

## Next Steps

1. Follow the steps above to add your email as test user
2. Restart your dev server
3. Try logging in again
4. If it works, start using the app!
5. If you still have issues, check `TROUBLESHOOTING.md`
